For individuals with disabilities, machine learning provides a powerful way to create more useful accessibility software. Individuals with hand disabilities can control their computer through voice recognition software.

However many models related to disability tasks suffer from a lack of data, well trained models, and an ecosystem through which to train them. Specialty machine learning tasks without monetary incentives often depend upon grassroots communities to collect data and improve models.

Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for improvement.
Implicitly through the use of disability software, individuals can quickly obtain valuable datasets for training future models. For instance, users with voice controlled software can generate and validate labeled audio files while dictating. Yet in order for this data to be used for others, there needs to be better options for trustfully sharing and distributing models across user communities. Disabled users and any other populations that will be crowd-sharing data should trust that they will continue to have autonomy and privacy when doing so.

In my project I will be creating

While I'm specifically interested in the application of this project on ML-related disability software these tools will generalize to any special to ML tasks.

- Decentralized
- Private
- Generalizable across machine learning tasks
