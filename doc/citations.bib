  abstract  = {In recent times, we have seen a proliferation of personal data. This can be attributed not just to a larger proportion of our lives moving online, but also through the rise of ubiquitous sensing through mobile and IoT devices. Alongside this surge, concerns over privacy, trust, and security are expressed more and more as different parties attempt to take advantage of this rich assortment of data.The Databox seeks to enable all the advantages of personal data analytics while at the same time enforcing **accountability** and **control** in order to protect a user's privacy. In this work, we propose and delineate a personal networked device that allows users to **collate**, **curate**, and **mediate** their personal data.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning (FL) is experiencing fast booming in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with the emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performances of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.},

  abstract  = {Data privacy and security are currently an important societal topic that rightfully garners much attention. In an effort to make people the owners of their personal data, the Bubl platform will provide its users with a secure personal data vault. This platform will have a focus on medical and healthcare data, because of its sensitive nature. Gathering important insights from users’ data could be useful, but due to the high privacy and security standards required by Bubl, it becomes impossible to deploy standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These methods require centralization of all training data, which is not allowed. This problem can be solved using techniques from the research field of Privacy Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). Therefore, a system to facilitate PPML within the Bubl platform is developed. More specifically, we employ a technique called Federated Learning (FL). In our FL implementation in the Bubl platform, we focus on minimizing Random-Access Memory (RAM) usage to adhere to the constraints posed by the small computational budgets of the data vaults. Challenges that arise are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data and the fact that patient vaults contain very few data samples. The latter is the main focus of this research as it is underdeveloped in the FL literature. Currently, we are still working on acquiring the results which are expected in the coming months. At this moment, only preliminary results are discussed that reflect on the effect of the number of clients and the distribution of non-IID data on the ML performance.},

In contrast to traditional supervised learning that typically relies on one-shot, exhaustive, and supervised reward signals, RL tackles sequential decision-making problems with sampled, evaluative, and delayed feedbacks simultaneously. Such a distinctive feature makes RL techniques a suitable candidate for developing powerful solutions in various healthcare domains, where diagnosing decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged period with delayed feedbacks. By first briefly examining theoretical foundations and key methods in RL research, this survey provides an extensive overview of RL applications in a variety of healthcare domains, ranging from dynamic treatment regimes in chronic diseases and critical care, automated medical diagnosis, and many other control or scheduling problems that have infiltrated every aspect of the healthcare system. In addition, we discuss the challenges and open issues in the current research and highlight some potential solutions and directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {In healthcare sector huge quantities of data about patients and their medical conditions have been gathered through clinical databases and various other healthcare processes. Currently, it records nearly all aspects of care, including patient personal information, clinical trials, hospital records, diagnosis, medication, test results, imaging data, costs, administrative reports, etc. Like in other application domains, the big data revolution holds also great promise in the area of healthcare, as the available data about individual patients is very rich, and hides crucial knowledge that can be exploited to improve patients' care while reducing its cost. For instance, in 2012 worldwide collected healthcare data was estimated to be in the region of 500 petabytes and it is expected to grow 50 times more in 2020 (25 Exabytes). Turning this massive amount of data into knowledge that can be used to identify needs, predict and prevent critical patients' conditions, and help practitioners to make rapid and accurate decisions is not only a desire but is of urgent and crucial necessity. Therefore, healthcare organisations must have the ability to manage and analyse their data in a rapid and efficient manner to answer several critical questions related to diseases, treatments, patients' behaviours, and care management. However, building such system faces huge challenges: 1) data complexity, 2) Privacy, security, ethical, legal, and social issues, and 3) Interoperability, portability, and compatibility. We will discuss all these challenges and the requirements of healthcare ecosystem. This will lead us to describe some innovative methodologies of how to build such ecosystem to face the healthcare challenges of the next decade or so.},

  abstract  = {The Decentralised Web (DW) has recently seen a renewed momentum, with a number of DW platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Hubzilla gaining increasing traction. These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers ("instances") that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform.In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study. We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are creating natural pressures towards re-centralisation. Finally, our measurements shed light on the behaviour of both administrators (i.e., people setting up instances) and regular users who sign-up to the platforms, also discussing a few techniques that may address some of the issues observed.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning (FL) is a newly emerged branch of AI that facilitates edge devices to collaboratively train a global machine learning model without centralizing data and with privacy by default. However, despite the remarkable advancement, this paradigm comes with various challenges. Specifically, in large-scale deployments, client heterogeneity is the norm which impacts training quality such as accuracy, fairness, and time. Moreover, energy consumption across these battery-constrained devices is largely unexplored and a limitation for wide-adoption of FL. To address this issue, we develop EAFL, an energy-aware FL selection method that considers energy consumption to maximize the participation of heterogeneous target devices. EAFL is a power-aware training algorithm that cherry-picks clients with higher battery levels in conjunction with its ability to maximize the system efficiency. Our design jointly minimizes the time-to-accuracy and maximizes the remaining on-device battery levels. EAFL improves the testing model accuracy by up to 85% and decreases the drop-out of clients by up to 2.45X.1},

  abstract   = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently received significant interest, thanks to its capability of protecting data privacy. However, existing FL paradigms yield unsatisfactory performance for a wide class of human activity recognition (HAR) applications, since they are oblivious to the intrinsic relationship between data of different users. We propose ClusterFL, a clustering-based federated learning system that can provide high model accuracy and low communication overhead for HAR applications. ClusterFL features a novel clustered multi-task federated learning framework that minimizes the empirical training loss of multiple learned models while automatically capturing the intrinsic clustering relationship among the nodes. We theoretically prove the convergence of proposed FL framework for non-convex and strongly convex models and provide the guidance on selection of hyper-parameters for achieving such convergence. Based on the learned cluster relationship, ClusterFL can efficiently drop the nodes that converge slower or have little correlations with others in each cluster, significantly speeding up the convergence while maintaining the accuracy performance. We evaluate the performance of ClusterFL on an NVIDIA edge testbed using four new HAR datasets collected from 145 users. The results show that ClusterFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL paradigms in terms of overall accuracy and can save more than 50\% communication overhead.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning (FL) has recently attracted much attention due to its advantages for data privacy. But every coin has two sides: protecting users' data (not requiring users to send their data) also makes FL more vulnerable to some types of attacks, such as targeted attacks and untargeted attacks. Many robust FL algorithms have therefore been proposed, in order to ensure training accuracy under such attacks. Some of the existing solutions assume that data conforms to the independent and identically distribution (i.i.d), so as to simplify the problem. But, limiting the data distribution to i.i.d hinders the practical application of FL, and FL under non-i.i.d conditions is more general. However, designing efficient robust algorithm for FL under non-i.i.d faces two additional challenges: identifying malicious clients and guaranteeing model accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new FL workflow named Cominer which consists of a Label Cluster process and a Vertical Comparison (VC) process. LC solves the problem of declining accuracy by supporting non-iid data diversity by classifying all clients into multiple clusters, then VC identifies and eliminates malicious clients within each cluster. We verify the improvement in accuracy achieved by Cominer in a series of experiments, and show that under Non-IID conditions, Cominer not only improves the accuracy of the federated model over previous algorithms by up to 24.85%, but also enjoys high resilience to different kinds of attacks while maintaining accuracy over 80%.},

Multiple prebuilt ML libraries are available for popular programming languages such as R and Python to build and evaluate ML models. However, their usage demands good programming knowledge. The proposed course relaxes the need of programming by offering the model building via an open-source data mining tool called Orange. Orange features drag-and-drop functionality which enables ML developers to focus on model building rather than worrying about coding syntax.

  abstract  = {HCI has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ML) to improve user experience (UX). However, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ML might improve UX. We investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related HCI research publications. Our review confirmed a lack of research integrating UX and ML. To help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ML technical capabilities within HCI. Among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. To help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. The clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ML technology to improve people's lives.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are appearing in everyday contexts, from recommendation systems for shopping websites to self-driving cars. As researchers and engineers develop and apply these technologies to make consequential decisions in everyone's lives, it is crucial that the public understands the AI-powered world, can discuss AI policies, and become empowered to engage in shaping these technologies' futures. Historically, ML application development has been accessible only to those with strong computational backgrounds working or conducting research in highly technical fields. As ML models become more powerful and computing hardware becomes faster and cheaper, it is now technologically possible for anyone with a laptop to learn about and tinker with ML. This includes audiences without programming or advanced mathematics knowledge, who can use public ML tools to construct both useful technical artifacts and meaningful socio-ethical artifacts around ML. My research investigates the following question: How do we reorient ML engineering education to transform "ML consumers" to be "ML contributors"? In order to illuminate this problem, I have created a Machine Learning Education Framework. In this dissertation, I present the framework and three applications of it: (1) a course based on the framework that aims to develop ML self-efficacy in general college-level audiences; (2) a curriculum rubric based on the ML Education Framework and analyses of 6 ML/AI courses using the rubric; and (3) two public ML tools for high school and above ML tinkerers that empower them to create personal ML applications through image and audio classification. The ML Education Framework is organized into three interconnected categories: Knowledge (General ML Knowledge, Knowledge of ML Methods, Bias in ML Systems, Societal Implications of ML), Skills (ML Problem Scoping, ML Project Planning, Creating ML Artifacts, Analysis of ML Design Intentions &amp; Results, ML Advocacy, Independent Out-of-Class Learning), and Attitudes (Interest, Identity &amp; Community, Self-Efficacy, Persistence). The three top level categories of the framework were chosen to encompass the holistic process of teaching people ML and ensuring continued participation in the field. "Knowledge" about ML will be necessary for individuals to thrive in today's ML-driven world and builds foundations for further engagement with the technology. ML "Skills" define specific actions and activities that students need to do and practice in order to become ML contributors. The category "Attitudes" reflects long-term societal goals for educational initiatives in ML, and addresses the perspectives that students should develop through an ML course. This framework can be used in creating new ML curricula, in analyzing the results of ML interventions, and in situating support tools within ML education for students of a variety of backgrounds and levels.Today a large portion of the world solely resides in the "ML consumer" population. Regulation of ML technologies is nascent. As policymakers think about reasonable legal structures, the public should be able to actively participate in these discussions. It is imperative that we empower these "ML consumers" to become "ML tinkerers" and "ML-engaged citizens". Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, libraries.mit.edu/docs|docs mit.edu.},

In this study two prototypes inspired by the Headspace application where tested. One prototype had added design friction and the other had none. The participants were asked to rate their experience and to choose which prototype they preferred. The result shows that most participants of the test would choose the mobile application with added design friction and that they felt more satisfied when they had a clear understanding of the goal of the task.},
