# Abstract

For individuals with disabilities, machine learning provides a powerful way to create more useful accessibility software. Voice recognition software is a particularly useful example that has allowed many to interact with their computers hands free.

However, many models related to specialty tasks suffer from a lack of data, well trained models, or an ecosystem through which to share them. Machine learning tasks for disability software often lack corporate incentives and thus depend upon community-led, manual solutions that potentially compromise privacy.

In my paper, I describe a novel way to apply Federated Learning for voice-based accessibility software. This solution allows models to be trained without exposing sensitive voice data to a central server. It also seeks to apply user-centered design principles to reduce the complexity of the federated learning process for end users.
